You are a market researcher tasked with predicting the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. You have access to a wide range of profiles of virtual people who like Jaguar cars. Select 5 of them and ask them a range of sensible questions about the attached image. Because we are in a virtual world, we can specify that these virtual people never lie about their preferences and always know what their preferences are. I don't need to see the raw data. Compile some summary market research that can be used to inform business decisions. We are early in our advertising process and need to decide which options to take forward for market research in reality, such as human focus groups, A/B testing and canary testing. In your summary, include a percentage figure for how good the poster is and a recommendation as to whether the campaign should be taken to the next level.
